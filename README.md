# Arete

Calisthenics standards for you.

## Overview

Arete is a web application that displays specific calisthenics movement
standards according to a person's gender, age, and body weight.

## Disclaimer

**Please note that the data used here is randomly generated but has
been reviewed and adjusted to make it more reasonable.**

Initially, my goal was to create this application to help people find exercise
targets within reasonable ranges based on their age, weight, and body type. I
planned to use data from various sites that provide exercise standards for
common exercises. However, when I requested permission to use their data in my
open-source application, most of them kindly asked me not to proceed.

As a result, I chose to randomly generate my own data while ensuring it
remained within reasonable limits. I also decided to focus solely on
calisthenics exercises to avoid the hassle of generating random yet reasonable
values for a larger variety of exercises.
